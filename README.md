### Short guide
1. Install environment from requirements.txt
2. Use preprocessing.py to preprocess a data set used in the project
3. Train a model using training.py
4. Use find_top_words.py to find most common adjectives and adverbs
5. Get correct model predictions for a given label with get_correct_predictions.py
6. Prepare and execute attack with prepare_attack.py and attack.py
7. Run plot_results.py to get confidence value histograms for BERT models and reading example for both T5 and BERT
8. Use analyze_results.py to get success rates of the attack
9. To print out reading examples, use pretty_displaying.py
10. To analyze adjective and adverb occurrences in different classes, use frequency_analysis.py

Make sure that each function gets proper input, such as folder or file paths as strings.
